# data_interview_materials

Having built and led multiple data teams at various companies, I've come to understand some of the hallmarks of a healthy data team.
In the simplest terms, a healthy data team has high employee satisfaction and low retention, and they deliver data products that are used regularly by multiple teams in the company. 

However, when you are interviewing it can be difficult to get a real sense of how healthy the data teams actually are.  I therefore wanted to provide some questions that experience has taught me are particularly revelatory. These are certainly not the ONLY questions you should ask, and it might not be critical to ask every single one.
Just think of these as questions that have a high probability of providing you with useful information.
